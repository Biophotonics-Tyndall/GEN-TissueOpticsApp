# GEN-TissueOpticsApp

## Description
This repository contains the Tissue Optics app used as a support for computer exercises on light propagation in 
tissue during the Biophotonics Workshop organised by the Irish Photonic Integration centre (IPIC) and sponsored 
by Science Fundation Ireland.

## App versions

### Web version
A version of this app that works inside a web browser app can be found in the javascript folder. 
This version has been written in javascript and do not require any installation to run. To run it locally on 
your own computer you simply need the source code, and to run a local webserver. Alternatively, the app is 
also hosted on Github Pages: https://biophotonics-tyndall.github.io/GEN-TissueOpticsApp/

### Matlab version
An executable file was packaged from the original matlab based app and can be found in the matlab folder. This executable
do not require to have matlab installed on the computer, however, it requires installing Matlab Runtime, which is free. 
See README file in corresponding folder for installation instructions.

## User Manual
User manuals for the app can be found:

The original computer exercise was developed for a Biophotonics course at the University of Lund Sweden by 
Stefan Andersson-Engels, Tomas Svensson and Johan Axelsson.

The first graphic user interface of this app was developed using MATLAB for the Biophotonics workshop of the 
Biophotonics@Tyndall team in Cork by Jacqueline Gunther.

The web version of the app has been developed for a remote version of the Biophotonics workshop in Cork by 
Baptiste Jayet and Jean S. Matias.

Thank you to Marcelo Nogueira and Jacqueline Gunther for corrections and suggestions.
We acknowledge the Biophotonics workshop organisers since 2018 for the feedback received to improve the app and 
for its promotion during the event.
