          This Tissue Optic application has been developed to teach concepts of optics in biological tissues. It used as a 
          support of one of the activity of the Biophotonics workshop organised by the <a href="https://www.ipic.ie/">Irish 
          Photonic Integration centre (IPIC)</a> and sponsored by <a href="https://www.sfi.ie/">Science Fundation Ireland</a>. 
          The content of activities was designed to match that of lectures, theoretical material, experiments and quizzes 
          offered during the workshop. You can find a user manual for this app on Researchgate by clicking <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/project/Biophotonics-education-apps">here</a>.

          This app is composed of 4 parts that can be accessed using the sidebar:
          <dl>
            <dt>Tissue absorption:</dt> 
              <dd>
                This page lets you visualise the absorption spectra of tissue when you change some of their characteristics
                such as the concentration of blood, the oxygen saturation, the concentration of water or the concentration of fat.
              </dd>
            <dt>Inverse tissue absorption:</dt>
              <dd>
                This page is an exercise where you can try to match the absorption spectra of a tissue with one of the reference 
                absorption spectra by changing the characteristics of the tissue.
              </dd>
            <dt>Effective attenuation coefficient:</dt>
              <dd>
                This page lets you calculate the effective attenuation spectrum that takes into account both the absorption and 
                the scattering properties of the tissue.
              </dd>
            <dt>Diffusion equation:</dt>
              <dd>
                This page lets you calculate the light intensity from the diffusion equation in three ideal scenarii: Inside a 
                1D infinite medium, inside a semi infinite medium and the reflectance at the boundary of a semi infinite medium.
